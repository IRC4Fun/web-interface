IRC4Fun _(Xtheme)_ Services **Web Interface**

[Web Interface](https://services.irc4fun.net/)  

This Web Interface is specific and built purposely for [IRC4Fun](https://irc4fun.net/), emulating GNUworld's website interface; since IRC4Fun was originally modeled after a _newer_ [Undernet](http://www.undernet.org/) with _modern services and nickname registration_.  

This is version 2.* of our Web Interface, originally built in 2010, is being enhanced to work with [Xtheme IRC Services](https://XthemeOrg.github.io/) with [IRC4Fun-specific](https://github.com/IRC4Fun/Xtheme/) modifications for it's network design and offerings.
